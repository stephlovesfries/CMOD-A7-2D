# CMOD-A7-2D
## Introduction 
SUTDicey is a hardware module (Figure 1) that provides an interactive solution for simulating dice rolls, offering users the ability to select and roll various types of dice, from 2-sided to 100-sided. Integrated with a tilt sensor and pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), it enables the real-time display of dice roll results on a 7-segment display, delivering an engaging experience for gaming and other applications. The video demonstration is submitted separately.
